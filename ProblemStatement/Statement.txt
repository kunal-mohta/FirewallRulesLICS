Problem Statement

Firewall rules are encoded in Prolog as facts and rules: each rule may start with accept (allow the incoming packet), reject (send reject information to sender), or drop (silently) followed by a clause. [see documentation for syntax]
Write a Prolog program to apply encoded rules on any incoming packet. Note that multiple rules may apply.
